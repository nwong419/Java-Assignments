# **Problem: Shapes**                                                                       

Implement a program that manages shapes. Implement a class named Shape with a method area() which returns the double value 0.0. Implement three derived classes named Rectangle, Square, and Circle. Declare necessary properties in each including getter and setter function and a constructor that sets the values of these properties. Override the area() function in each by calculating the area using the defined properties in that class.

Write a program that repeatedly shows the user a menu to create one of the three main shapes or to print the shapes created so far. If the user selects to create a new shape, the program prompts the user to enter the values for the size( How many ) of the selected shape. The shape is then stored in an array. If the user selects to print the current shapes, print the name and the total area of each shape to the console.

Hint: You may limit the size of the array to 10. Do Not USE ArrayList.
